# Python API Challenge - OpenWeatherMap

### Observations

- There is a nice trend, as expected, of temperatures generally getting warmer as one approaches the equator and gradually cooling at points farther north and south. 

- There is no obvious trend or pattern when comparing humidity against latitude. Humidity does seem high across the entire dataset. Most cities show reports of greater than 60% humidity and a significant amount of them show 100% humidity. 

- There is also not an obvious trend when comparing cloudiness against latitude. Most of the cities' cloudiness percentages are reported at 0, 20, 75, and around 90%.
